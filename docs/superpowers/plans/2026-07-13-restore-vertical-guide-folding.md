# Restore Vertical Guide Folding Implementation Plan

> **Superseded nested targeting:** The outermost-only mapping in this historical plan is replaced by the exact pressed-boundary mapping in [`2026-07-13-nested-native-guide-targeting-design.md`](../specs/2026-07-13-nested-native-guide-targeting-design.md). Direct-child batch folding, persistent native guides, and selection safety remain current.

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Restore legacy vertical-guide clicks so a persistent native guide targets the outermost real list ancestor and batch-toggles that ancestor's direct child branches in both directions without reopening a branch that contains the cursor.

**Architecture:** Keep Obsidian's native `.cm-indent::before` rendering and capture-phase guide handler. Promote CodeMirror-owned `.cm-indent-spacing` spans into native `.cm-indent` spans during measurement writes so a guide remains after folding, map the pressed segment to its outermost real list ancestor, then run the legacy direct-child batch algorithm through `MyEditor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible`.

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5.9, Obsidian 1.13.1, CodeMirror 6, Jest 30, Rollup 4.

## Global Constraints

- Use normal `git` on `main`; do not use GitButler.
- Do not reintroduce overlay DOM, measurements, coordinate caches, or scroll synchronization.
- Keep `.cm-indent::before` as the only vertical-guide rendering source.
- Do not duplicate native guide geometry or theme CSS; add and remove the native `.cm-indent` class on existing spacing spans and reset only its marker-owned `min-width`/`display` layout changes.
- Keep `contentDOM` capture-phase `mousedown` handling and listener cleanup unchanged.
- Map one native `.cm-indent` to the outermost real list ancestor before the parser's synthetic root.
- Never fold or unfold the represented parent itself from a vertical-guide click.
- Ignore direct leaves and batch-toggle only direct children for which `isEmpty()` is false.
- If any collected child is open, fold every collected child; if all are folded, unfold every collected child.
- Use each child branch's own first-line content start as the fallback cursor when folding.
- Build with `npm run build-with-tests` before running the full Jest suite because Markdown integration specs execute `dist/main.js`.
- Use English Conventional Commits with detailed `Why` and `What` sections.
- Do not release or change the package version unless the user separately requests a release.
- Use the repository's `/Users/kodai/workspaces/github.com/kdnk/obsidian-bullet/vault` for manual Obsidian verification; never copy test artifacts or notes into `/Users/kodai/base`.

## File Structure

- Modify: `src/features/VerticalLines.ts` — implement direct-child batch folding and unfolding.
- Modify: `src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts` — restore the legacy helper contract, persistent native segments, and handler-level regression coverage.
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-restore-vertical-guide-folding.md` — record completed steps and final verification evidence.
- Temporary manual-test fixture: `vault/vertical-guide-regression-test.md` — exercise the built plugin in the repository's test vault, then remove it after verification.

### Task 1: Restore the Direct-Child Batch Contract

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts:217-415`
- Modify: `src/features/VerticalLines.ts:22-38`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `List.getChildren(): List[]`, `List.isEmpty(): boolean`, `List.isFolded(): boolean`, and `List.getFirstLineContentStart(): MyEditorPosition`.
- Consumes: `MyEditor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible(line: number, fallbackCursor: MyEditorPosition): void` and `MyEditor.unfold(line: number): void`.
- Produces: `toggleVerticalGuideTarget(editor, list): boolean`, where `true` means a direct-child batch action was selected and `false` means the target has no foldable direct child branches.

- [x] **Step 1: Replace the parent-self helper tests with the legacy batch expectations**

Replace the first two tests in `describe("toggleVerticalGuideTarget")` with:

```ts
test("folds each direct non-empty child when any branch is open", () => {
  const root = makeRoot({
    editor: makeEditor({
      text,
      cursor: { line: 0, ch: 0 },
      getAllFoldedLines: () => [1],
    }),
  });
  const parent = root.getListUnderLine(0);
  if (!parent) {
    throw new Error("Expected a parent list");
  }
  const editor = makeFoldEditor();

  expect(toggleVerticalGuideTarget(editor, parent)).toBe(true);
  expect(editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(1, 1, {
    line: 1,
    ch: 4,
  });
  expect(editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(2, 4, {
    line: 4,
    ch: 4,
  });
  expect(editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
  expect(editor.unfold).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});

test("unfolds each direct non-empty child when every branch is folded", () => {
  const root = makeRoot({
    editor: makeEditor({
      text,
      cursor: { line: 0, ch: 0 },
      getAllFoldedLines: () => [1, 4],
    }),
  });
  const parent = root.getListUnderLine(0);
  if (!parent) {
    throw new Error("Expected a parent list");
  }
  const editor = makeFoldEditor();

  expect(toggleVerticalGuideTarget(editor, parent)).toBe(true);
  expect(editor.unfold).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(1, 1);
  expect(editor.unfold).toHaveBeenNthCalledWith(2, 4);
  expect(editor.unfold).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
  expect(editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

These expectations prove that the represented parent at line `0` and the direct leaf at line `3` are untouched.

- [x] **Step 2: Update the handler regression expectation**

In `test("folds the ancestor represented by a native indentation guide")`, replace the parent-self expectation with:

```ts
expect(editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1, {
  line: 1,
  ch: 4,
});
expect(editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
expect(editor.unfold).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
```

Keep the existing assertions for `handleMouseDown`, `posAtDOM`, parser input, and `preventDefault`.

- [x] **Step 3: Run the focused tests and verify the regression tests fail**

Run:

```bash
SKIP_OBSIDIAN=1 npx jest --forceExit --runInBand src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL. The current implementation calls `foldEnsuringCursorVisible(0, { line: 0, ch: 2 })` once for the represented parent, rather than lines `1` and `4` for its child branches; the fully folded case also unfolds line `0` rather than lines `1` and `4`.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement the minimal direct-child batch algorithm**

Replace `toggleVerticalGuideTarget`'s body with:

```ts
const children = list.getChildren().filter((child) => !child.isEmpty());
if (children.length === 0) {
  return false;
}

const shouldUnfold = children.every((child) => child.isFolded());
for (const child of children) {
  const fallbackCursor = child.getFirstLineContentStart();
  if (shouldUnfold) {
    editor.unfold(fallbackCursor.line);
  } else {
    editor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible(fallbackCursor.line, fallbackCursor);
  }
}

return true;
```

Do not change `resolveVerticalGuideTarget`, the event listener, or `MyEditor.foldEnsuringCursorVisible` in this task. Task 2 corrects the mapping after live Obsidian evidence invalidated the earlier assumption.

- [x] **Step 5: Run the focused tests and verify they pass**

Run:

```bash
SKIP_OBSIDIAN=1 npx jest --forceExit --runInBand src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts src/editor/__tests__/index.test.ts
```

Expected: both suites PASS. The vertical-guide suite proves legacy batch targeting, and the editor suite continues to prove atomic selection relocation.

- [x] **Step 6: Run static checks**

Run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Expected: Prettier reports all matched files use its style and ESLint exits with status `0` and no warnings.

- [x] **Step 7: Commit the implementation**

Run:

```bash
git add src/features/VerticalLines.ts src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts
git commit -m "fix(vertical-lines): restore child branch toggling" \
  -m "Why:
- Native guide clicks currently fold the represented parent itself, hiding direct items that the legacy interaction kept visible.
- Selection-safe folding must remain in place so a cursor inside a child branch does not reopen the fold.

What:
- Batch-toggle the represented parent's direct non-empty children.
- Fold each child with its own visible fallback cursor and unfold all children only when every branch is folded.
- Restore helper and handler regression coverage for the legacy contract."
```

Expected: the commit succeeds and its hooks pass.

### Task 2: Map the Native Guide to the Outermost Real Ancestor

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts:149-216,387-422`
- Modify: `src/features/VerticalLines.ts:16-19`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `List.getParent(): List | null` and the parser convention that the top container has no parent.
- Produces: `resolveVerticalGuideTarget(list): List | null`, selecting the last real ancestor before the synthetic root.

- [x] **Step 1: Change the deep mapping test to require the outermost real ancestor**

For `- parent / - child / - grandchild`, require the guide on `grandchild` to resolve to line `0`, not line `1`. Keep the leading-indentation, note-line, and root-item cases.

- [x] **Step 2: Strengthen the handler regression with the live fixture shape**

Use the `parent / branch one / leaf one / leaf sibling / branch two / leaf two` fixture. Dispatch the guide event from the `leaf one` line and require folds for branch roots at lines `1` and `4`, never the immediate parent alone.

- [x] **Step 3: Run the focused test and confirm RED**

Run:

```bash
SKIP_OBSIDIAN=1 npx jest --forceExit --runInBand src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL because the deep mapping returns line `1`, and the handler targets only the immediate parent.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement the minimal ancestor walk**

Walk upward from the pressed line's owning list. Remember each ancestor that itself has a parent, and return the last such ancestor. This excludes the parser's synthetic root and returns `null` for a root list item.

- [x] **Step 5: Run focused tests and lint**

Run:

```bash
SKIP_OBSIDIAN=1 npx jest --forceExit --runInBand src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts src/editor/__tests__/index.test.ts
npm run lint
```

Expected: both suites and lint pass.

- [x] **Step 6: Commit the mapping correction**

Create an English Conventional Commit with detailed `Why` and `What` sections. Include only the source and unit-test changes in the implementation commit.

### Task 3: Keep Native Guide Segments Available After Folding

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/features/VerticalLines.ts`
- Modify: `src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts`
- Modify: `styles.css`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: existing `.cm-hmd-list-indent > .cm-indent-spacing` elements inside `EditorView.contentDOM`.
- Produces: plugin-owned promotions carrying both `.cm-indent` and `.bullet-plugin-persistent-indent-guide`.
- Uses: `EditorView.requestMeasure` write phase, `PluginValue.update`, `Settings.onChange`, and `Settings.removeCallback`.

- [x] **Step 1: Add failing promotion-helper tests**

Add tests proving that synchronization:

1. Adds `.cm-indent` and `.bullet-plugin-persistent-indent-guide` only to spacing spans that are not already native guides.
2. Leaves pre-existing native `.cm-indent` elements unowned and untouched.
3. Removes both added classes from plugin-owned spans when disabled.
4. Does not remove a native guide that lacks the plugin marker.
5. Requires marker-scoped CSS to keep promoted spans at their original inline width (`min-width: 0; display: inline`).
6. Requires the promoted native `::before` to stack above the folded branch chevron (`z-index: 2`) without changing guide geometry.

- [x] **Step 2: Add failing ViewPlugin lifecycle tests**

Extend the constructor/destroy test and add update/setting coverage proving that:

1. Construction subscribes to settings and requests a measurement write.
2. The write synchronizes against the current `contentDOM` and current `verticalLines` value.
3. A view update and a setting callback each schedule synchronization.
4. Destroy removes the capture listener, unregisters the setting callback, and synchronously removes plugin-owned promotions.
5. A queued write after destroy is a no-op.

- [x] **Step 3: Run the focused vertical-line test and confirm RED**

Run:

```bash
SKIP_OBSIDIAN=1 npx jest --forceExit --runInBand src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL because no promotion helper or lifecycle synchronization exists.

- [x] **Step 4: Implement minimal persistent native-guide promotion**

Implement an exported synchronization helper and integrate it into `VerticalLinesPluginValue`:

1. Select only `.cm-hmd-list-indent > .cm-indent-spacing:not(.cm-indent)` for new ownership.
2. Add `.cm-indent` plus a plugin marker class.
3. On disable or cleanup, remove both classes only from marker elements.
4. Schedule synchronization with `view.requestMeasure({ key, write })` after construction, every view update, and settings changes.
5. Subscribe/unsubscribe the per-view settings callback.
6. Guard queued writes after destroy.

Add only marker-scoped CSS that resets `min-width` and `display` and raises the existing `::before` above the chevron with `z-index: 2`; do not define guide offset, width, border, color, or theme behavior. Do not add DOM elements, measurements, observers, animation frames, or coordinate state. Existing `.cm-indent::before` and cursor styling must render the promoted spans.

- [x] **Step 5: Run focused GREEN tests and lint**

Run:

```bash
SKIP_OBSIDIAN=1 npx jest --forceExit --runInBand src/features/__tests__/VerticalLines.test.ts src/editor/__tests__/index.test.ts
npm run lint
git diff --check
```

Expected: focused suites, lint, and diff check pass.

- [x] **Step 6: Commit the persistent-guide implementation**

Commit the source/test/style changes with an English Conventional Commit and detailed `Why`/`What`. The implementation may use a follow-up commit if a layout-preservation defect is discovered after the initial promotion commit.

### Task 4: Complete Automated and Obsidian Verification

**Files:**
- Create temporarily: `vault/vertical-guide-regression-test.md`
- Delete after verification: `vault/vertical-guide-regression-test.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: production `dist/main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.
- Produces: evidence that the restored interaction works in Obsidian 1.13.1 and that all automated checks pass.

- [x] **Step 1: Build the test-enabled bundle before the full suite**

Run:

```bash
npm run build-with-tests
```

Expected: Rollup completes successfully and produces a test-enabled `dist/main.js`.

- [x] **Step 2: Run the complete Jest suite**

Run:

```bash
npm test -- --runInBand
```

Expected: all test suites pass. Jest may print the repository's existing `--forceExit` advisory, but there must be no failed suite or failed test.

- [x] **Step 3: Build the production bundle**

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Expected: Rollup completes successfully and replaces `dist/main.js` with the production bundle.

- [x] **Step 4: Install the production artifacts into the repository test vault**

Run:

```bash
cp dist/main.js manifest.json styles.css vault/.obsidian/plugins/bullet/
shasum -a 256 dist/main.js manifest.json styles.css vault/.obsidian/plugins/bullet/main.js vault/.obsidian/plugins/bullet/manifest.json vault/.obsidian/plugins/bullet/styles.css
```

Expected: each repository artifact has the same SHA-256 hash as its installed counterpart.

- [x] **Step 5: Create an isolated manual-test note**

Use `apply_patch` to create `vault/vertical-guide-regression-test.md` with exactly:

```md
- parent
  - branch one
    - leaf one
  - leaf sibling
  - branch two
    - leaf two
- branches only
  - branch alpha
    - leaf alpha
  - branch beta
    - leaf beta
- scroll filler 01
- scroll filler 02
- scroll filler 03
- scroll filler 04
- scroll filler 05
- scroll filler 06
- scroll filler 07
- scroll filler 08
- scroll filler 09
- scroll filler 10
- scroll filler 11
- scroll filler 12
- scroll filler 13
- scroll filler 14
- scroll filler 15
- scroll filler 16
- scroll filler 17
- scroll filler 18
- scroll filler 19
- scroll filler 20
- scroll filler 21
- scroll filler 22
- scroll filler 23
- scroll filler 24
- scroll filler 25
- scroll filler 26
- scroll filler 27
- scroll filler 28
- scroll filler 29
- scroll filler 30
```

- [x] **Step 6: Verify the interaction in Obsidian 1.13.1**

Open the isolated note and reload the plugin with the test vault explicitly selected:

```bash
/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/obsidian-cli vault=vault open path=vertical-guide-regression-test.md
/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/obsidian-cli vault=vault plugin:reload id=bullet
```

Before every Computer Use action, focus the test renderer with:

```bash
/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/obsidian-cli vault=vault eval code='window.focus()'
```

Fetch a fresh full app state in the same action unit and proceed only if the title identifies the `vault` test vault and does not identify `base`. Never reuse a prior element index or coordinate. If the guide is not exposed to accessibility, use `vault=vault eval` only to add a temporary unique `aria-label`, `role="button"`, and `tabindex="-1"` to that exact `.cm-indent`; do not dispatch an event or change editor/fold state through eval. The actual click must come from Computer Use using the freshly exposed element.

Then use Live Preview and verify:

1. Place the cursor in `leaf one` and click the vertical guide represented by `parent`.
2. Confirm `parent`, `branch one`, `leaf sibling`, and `branch two` remain visible.
3. Confirm `leaf one` and `leaf two` become hidden and remain hidden after the mouse interaction completes.
4. Confirm a promoted `.cm-indent-spacing.cm-indent.bullet-plugin-persistent-indent-guide` remains on a visible branch root or direct leaf, click that guide, and confirm both leaves return.
5. Fold only `branch one`, click the guide, and confirm both branch roots end folded.
6. For `branches only`, fold both branches through its guide, confirm promoted guide segments remain on the folded roots, click the one-pixel line rather than the surrounding chevron, and confirm both leaves return.
7. Scroll the note and confirm the native guide remains attached to the list; no overlay or drift appears.

Expected: every check passes, including the inside-selection case that previously reopened immediately.

- [x] **Step 7: Remove temporary accessibility metadata and the isolated manual-test note**

Use `apply_patch` to delete `vault/vertical-guide-regression-test.md` after the Obsidian checks pass.

- [x] **Step 8: Confirm the repository is clean except for the plan record**

Run:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
```

Expected: only this implementation plan is modified to record completed checkboxes and verification results; `git diff --check` exits successfully.

### Task 5: Record Verification and Push `main`

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-restore-vertical-guide-folding.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: focused-test, lint, full-suite, production-build, artifact-hash, and Obsidian verification results from Tasks 1 through 4.
- Produces: a durable execution record on `main` and an updated `origin/main`.

- [x] **Step 1: Record the completed verification results**

Mark every completed checkbox in this plan as `[x]` and append a `## Verification Results` section containing:

```md
## Verification Results

- Focused vertical-guide and editor tests: PASS
- Lint: PASS
- Test-enabled build: PASS
- Complete Jest suite: PASS (55 suites, 323 passed, 14 skipped)
- Production build: PASS
- Installed artifact hashes: MATCH
- Obsidian 1.13.1 legacy batch folding: PASS
- Obsidian 1.13.1 inside-selection fold persistence: PASS
- Native guide scrolling/alignment: PASS
```

If the exact Jest summary values printed in Task 4 differ from these expected counts, replace this line with the observed values before committing the record.

- [x] **Step 2: Review the final diff and history**

Run:

```bash
git diff --check
git diff -- docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-restore-vertical-guide-folding.md
git log --oneline --decorate -5
```

Expected: the plan contains only accurate execution evidence, the implementation commit follows the design commit, and no unrelated files are changed.

- [x] **Step 3: Commit the execution record**

Run:

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-restore-vertical-guide-folding.md
git commit -m "docs: record restored vertical guide folding" \
  -m "Why:
- The compatibility fix needs a durable record of its TDD cycle and real Obsidian verification.

What:
- Mark the implementation plan complete.
- Record automated checks, installed artifact hashes, and legacy interaction results."
```

Expected: the commit succeeds and its hooks pass.

- [x] **Step 4: Recheck upstream and push the verified commits**

Run:

```bash
git fetch
git pull --ff-only
git push origin main
```

Expected: the pull is fast-forward-only or already up to date, and `origin/main` advances to the verification-record commit without a pull request.

- [x] **Step 5: Confirm the final repository state**

Run:

```bash
git status --short
git log --oneline --decorate -5
```

Expected: the worktree is clean and `HEAD`, `main`, and `origin/main` point to the same final commit. No package version or release tag is created.
