## 5.4.4

### Vertical Indentation Lines

- Kept vertical indentation guides visible during mobile scrolling when
  CodeMirror temporarily cannot provide either character coordinates or the
  rendered line element.

## 5.4.3

### Vertical Indentation Lines

- Kept vertical indentation guides visible when CodeMirror cannot provide
  character coordinates for a clipped visible range, falling back to the
  rendered line padding instead.

## 5.4.2

### Vertical Indentation Lines

- Fixed vertical indentation guides disappearing after scrolling below the
  parent list item that owns the guide.

### Release

- Added a release workflow guard so tag names must match the package,
  manifest, and versions metadata before publishing assets.

## 5.4.1

### Vertical Indentation Lines

- Fixed vertical indentation guides disappearing when a long note line extends
  beyond the visible editor range.

## 5.3.4

### Release Notes

- Added consolidated v5 release notes to the current release entry so the
  in-app release notes dialog shows the v5 summary when updating from 5.3.3.

### v5 Highlights

Obsidian Bullet v5 focuses on making list editing feel more consistent across
desktop, mobile, Vim mode, pop-out windows, and custom themes.

### Cursor Behavior

- Improved cursor recovery around folded lists, checkboxes, ordered lists, and
  the first row of a list.
- Added an <kbd>Alt</kbd> / <kbd>Option</kbd> override for temporarily keeping
  the cursor outside bullet and checkbox markup.
- Preserved native document navigation shortcuts while improving list-aware
  ArrowLeft and Vim `j` / `k` behavior.

### Enter Behavior

- Shift-Enter now creates note lines without bullets.
- Enter can continue existing note lines instead of forcing a new bullet.
- Enter preserves checkbox state when inserting above tasks.
- Ordered-list cursor alignment was fixed around item `10` and later.
- Enter behavior avoids fenced code blocks outside the parsed list root.

### List Movement

- Improved movement for irregular indentation and legacy list items.
- Added broader regression coverage for moving, indenting, outdenting, and
  selecting list content.

### Vertical Indentation Lines

  and mobile layouts.

  jumping straight to the whole parsed root.
